    "- **Project Title:** *LLM-as-a-Judge in Recommendations using BigQuery AI: From Profiles to Insights*\n",
    "- **Problem Statement:** Most recommendation systems function as “black boxes,” surfacing items without offering context or transparency. This project uses BigQuery AI to automatically generate structured profiles of users and items, transform them into embeddings, and apply vector search to retrieve the most relevant matches. Each recommendation is then paired with an LLM-generated judgement, providing narrative reasoning that makes the system’s suggestions more interpretable.\n",
    "- **Impact Statement:** This solution shows how organizations can build scalable, explainable recommendation engines directly within BigQuery without the need for specialized machine learning teams. By combining personalization with transparency, the approach improves user trust, helps businesses uncover actionable behavioral patterns, and extends seamlessly to domains such as e-commerce and media.\n",
    "- **Project Highlights**\n",
    "    - Developed adaptable, structured profiles for users and recipes using BigQuery AI, enabling easy customization for various business domains.\n",
    "    - Demonstrated that a straightforward recommendation system powered by BigQuery AI can slightly outperform the ALS baseline, simplifying implementation and highlighting the potential of LLMs in recommendation workflows.\n",
    "    - Created an interactive UI for users to browse personalized recommendations alongside clear, LLM-generated explanations."

    "We obtain a `0.01680` in our metric (`recall@20`), which can seem small at first glance. However, in other work such as the [H\\&M](https://www.kaggle.com/code/julian3833/h-m-implicit-als-model-0-014) competition and the [LlamaRec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02089) paper, recommendation metrics are typically small, and gains often show up in the second or third decimal place. Our implementation shows that BigQuery AI with vector search can cut the build time for a recommender from weeks to hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a stronger retrieval stage, no matter the algorithm or heuristic, we can use `AI.GENERATE` to re rank the candidates, following a strategy like [LlamaRec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02089). For more ideas, see advanced techniques in [LRU](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02367) and [Generative Retrieval](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/20dcab0f14046a5c6b02b61da9f13229-Paper-Conference.pdf).\n",

    "This approach also fits a hybrid recommender that blends collaborative filtering with content based filtering. You can even feed the embeddings as features to a neural network. The use of embeddings opens up many possibilities and BigQuery AI makes it easy to experiment with them.\n",

    "Following the ideas of the [Spotify paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3705328.3759305) accepted on RecSys'25 conference, we can use LLMs as offline judges to assess the quality of recommendations, in contrast to traditional offline metrics (e.g., recall@K) that suffer from exposure bias. This methodology could be considered as an intermediate step between offline metrics and online A/B testing, which is often costly and time-consuming, providing a more efficient way to evaluate and compare recommendation systems."

    "## Feedback on BigQuery AI features\n",
    "- Passing Pydantic attribute descriptions as LLM schemas was difficult at first, so we wrote a helper that injects each field’s description into the prompt. A more direct mapping from Pydantic (including field names, data type, descriptions and constraints) to schemas would help. Pydantic is widely used in the Python ecosystem, including in popular libraries like LangChain and Instructor, so this would be a valuable enhancement.\n",
    "- LLM calls were slow even with lightweight models, so we limited the number of recipes and users. Faster execution and built-in progress reporting would be valuable.\n",
    "- When outputs exceed the token limit, quoting errors can appear. Clearer messages and partial-result handling would ease debugging and prevent entire queries from failing.\n",
    "- Gemini Embedding 001 sometimes returns empty embeddings for certain inputs; the cause remains unclear.\n",
